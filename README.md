# GhibliFilmsApp

The purpose of this project is:
* Create an application that lists and allows you to search for Ghibli estudio films. the Seeker have to support autocomplete.

the application given was created following a SPA (Single Page Application). Not only does it allow to have an excellent user experience, but also it a quick solution.

## architecture

As mentioned before the project was created as a SPA (Single Page Application). A SPAs are applications that only haves one URL and is loaded just one time. Under the same URL all the components and procedures will be executed.

## Trade-offs

1. I would like to improve the homepage, putting more infomation, trying to make it more friendly to the user.

2. I will put the content in the middle, whe the page is open on a big screen all the DOM is more in the left side rather than the rigth side.

3. I would add more images for each film information page that could load different images each time.

4. Improve the serch method for the films.

5. Create Testing sets,
